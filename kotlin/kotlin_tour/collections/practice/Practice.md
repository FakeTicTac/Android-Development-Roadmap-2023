# Practice

## Task 01:

You have a list of “green” numbers and a list of “red” numbers. 
Complete the code to print how many numbers there are in total.

```
fun main() {
    val greenNumbers = listOf(1, 4, 23)
    val redNumbers = listOf(17, 2)
    // Write your code here
}
```

## Task 02:

You have a set of protocols supported by your server. A user requests to use a particular protocol. 
Complete the program to check whether the requested protocol is supported or not (isSupported must be a Boolean value).

```
fun main() {
    val SUPPORTED = setOf("HTTP", "HTTPS", "FTP")
    val requested = "smtp"
    val isSupported = // Write your code here 
    println("Support for $requested: $isSupported")
}
```

## Task 03:

Define a map that relates integer numbers from 1 to 3 to their corresponding spelling. 
Use this map to spell the given number.

```
fun main() {
    val number2word = // Write your code here
    val n = 2
    println("$n is spelt as '${<Write your code here >}'")
}
```
