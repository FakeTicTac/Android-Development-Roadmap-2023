# Getting familiar with Kotlin

## Hello World

* ```fun``` is used to declare a function
* the ```main()``` function is where your program starts from
* the body of a function is written within curly braces ```{}```
* ```println()``` and ```print()``` functions print their arguments to standard output
  1. ```println()``` prints value with new line at the end.
  2. ```print()``` just prints the value.

## Variables

* read-only variables with ```val```
* mutable variables with ```var```

## String templates

A string value is a sequence of characters in double quotes ". Template expressions always start with a dollar sign $.
```println("Hello, $name!")```
